Problem Statement: The information services client has multiple business units. The time taken to aquire a potential entity as a 
customer is very long and wants better suggestion of products to the customers in order to appease them

Modelling:
Implemented and built Content based Recommender system, Collaborative recommender system an hybrid models.

Content Based filtering Recommender systems was plausible only with existing customers entry into new business units. Since this mode type cannot 
handle new customers well.

Collaborative filtering Recommender systems: 2 types were implemented

User-based collaborative filtering: 
In this model products are recommended to a user based on the fact that the products have been liked by users similar to the user.
For example if Derrick and Dennis like the same movies and a new movie comes out that Derick likes,then we can recommend that movie 
to Dennis because Derrick and Dennis seem to like the same movies.

Item-based collaborative filtering: 
This system identify similar items based on usersâ€™ previous ratings. For example if users A,B and C gave a 5 star rating to books X and Y
then when a user D buys book Y they also get a recommendation to purchase book X because the system identifies book X and Y as similar
based on the ratings of users A,B and C.

Also used hybrid Recommender systems:
Combined Content based system and Collaborative filtering by using the average of the two.

Evaluation:
The recommender systems were evaluated using 3 metrics:
Recall
Precision
RMSE = Root Mean Squared Error
