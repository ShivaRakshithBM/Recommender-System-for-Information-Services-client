Problem Statement: The information services client has multiple business units. The time taken to aquire a potential entity as a 
customer is very long and wants better suggestion of products to the customers in order to appease them

Implemented and built Content based Recommender system, Collaborative recommender system an hybrid models.

Content Based filtering Recommender systems was plausible only with existing customers entry into new business units. Since this mode type cannot 
handle new customers well.

Collaborative filtering Recommender systems: 2 types were implemented
1) User - User collaborative filtering:

Recommended products based on the the similarity between the customers

2) Item - Item collaborative filtering

Recommended the products based on the similarity between the products or items based on the ratings given by the users
